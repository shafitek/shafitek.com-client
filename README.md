***This repo only contains the front-end implementation.**

## Entire Website Tech Stack: 
### Front end: JavaScript (w/ React), HTML, CSS (w/ SaSS preprocessing)
    npm packages used: check 'package.json'
### Back end: Node.js (w/ Express.js)
    Some of the npm packages used: Sequelize ORM, helmet, multer, etc.

P.S. I learned React and SaSS on the fly as I was building my website.
